# Chocolate Shipments Dashboard - Power BI Project

Hi! 👋
This project is a Power BI dashboard I created using wholesale chocolate shipment data. The goal was to turn raw data into clear visuals and insights to better understand sales and shipping trends.

## 🗂️ About the Project

* **Data Source**: Chocolate shipment data from a wholesale source (Excel file)
* **Tool Used**: Power BI
* **What It Shows**: Sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and more

## 📊 What’s in the Dashboard?

Here are some of the things you’ll find:

* **Total Shipments** and **Revenue Overview**
* **Top-Selling Products**
* **Monthly Trends** – how sales and shipments change over time
* **Customer Insights** – who buys the most, how often, etc.
* **Geographic Data** (if included in your dataset)
  

## 🧹 How I Cleaned and Prepared the Data

Before building the dashboard, I:

* Removed empty or incorrect values
* Made sure all dates and numbers were in the right format
* Added new columns and measures to calculate totals, trends, etc.


## 🔍 Key Insights

From this dashboard, you can learn:

* Which chocolate products sell the most
* How sales are trending each month
* Which customers are the most valuable
* Seasonal patterns in shipments
